//! `EF_LED_CONF` wire-format codec — the persisted LED config block shared by the
//! firmware (`firmware/src/led.rs`) and the `rsk led` host tool.
//!
//! The current block is `[steady, (effect, color, brightness, speed) × N_STATUS]`
//! (17 bytes). [`LedConfig::apply_block`] also accepts the older 13-byte
//! (pre-speed), 9-byte (pre-effect), and 2/3-byte (idle-only legacy) layouts
//! written by earlier firmware, so a flash record survives a firmware upgrade
//! without losing a field — anything the shorter block omits keeps its current
//! value.
//!
//! The per-status factory look (`DEFAULT_*`) lives here too, because the codec
//! enforces the touch-indicator policy on every decode — see
//! [`LedConfig::enforce_touch_invariants`].
//!
//! This crate is deliberately pure (no `embassy` / HAL dependency) so the codec
//! is unit-testable on the host. The firmware's `led.rs` owns the live atomics,
//! the effect rendering, and the PIO task, and marshals them through
//! [`LedConfig`]; nothing here touches hardware.
