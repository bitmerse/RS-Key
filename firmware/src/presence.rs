//! Physical user presence over either the BOOTSEL button (default) or a dedicated
//! GPIO button (`PRESENCE_PIN`). BOOTSEL samples use the QSPI-CS-to-Hi-Z trick in a
//! RAM function; a GPIO button is polled active-low with an internal pull-up by
//! default, or active-high with a pull-down when `PRESENCE_ACTIVE_HIGH` is set. The
//! wait blocks the worker while the high-priority transports stream keepalives
//! reporting `UPNEEDED` ([`up_pending`]). One `ButtonPresence` serves every
//! applet's `UserPresence` trait; a touch is required by default, and the opt-in
//! `no-touch` feature makes `request` confirm instantly (for the automated suites,
//! which cannot press a button). The `display` build takes presence from the
//! touchscreen (`crate::display::TouchPresence`) instead, so the button backend
//! below is compiled out there.
//!
//! The arbitration itself — which transport owns the wait, whose cancel may end
//! it, and the `spent` latch that stops one hold satisfying two ceremonies —
//! lives in [`rsk_device::presence`], where it is host-tested and carries the
//! Kani harnesses for `NoCrossTransportTouchConsumption`. What stays here is the
//! board half: the button sample, the embassy clock, the LED indicator, and the
//! one `static` the transport and worker executors share.
